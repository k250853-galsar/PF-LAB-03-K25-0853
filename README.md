## Description
I'm Tushar Kumar and I'm 18. My programming background starts from when I was 13. I learnt HTML and CSS at the beginning. Then I learnt C language in my 12th. From that background, programming became my passion and career for future. I'm motivated to bring innovatory projects in the world of programming.
